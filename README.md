## Benchmarking Storage options for Raspberry Pi

The scope of this project is benchmarking the different storage options at my disposal for running Ubuntu 20.04 on RaspberryPI
Different options that will be tested are:

1) Internal SDCard
2) External USB 3.0 (no SSD)
3) SCSI using a Target SCSI running on Raspberry PI using as USB 3.0 SSD disk

For the testing a tweaked version of the script provided by James A. Chambers (https://jamesachambers.com/) will be used
